# Overview 

The purpose of this project is to create an interactive dashboard to visualize the bacteria data for each volunteer. The dropdown menu allows the sample to be selected and the visualizations will update with the data associated with that sample. Once selected, the data will display the top ten bacteria cultures found in the sample, the number of washes the volunteer performs per week, and a bubble chart with size markers reflecting how many different species of bacteria were cultured per sample.
